Interactive Brokers: Historical Data Limitations

1) Historical data requests that use a bar size below 30 seconds can only go back six months.
2) Historical data requests can go back one full calendar year.

3)
The error code and message that indicates a pacing violation is:
162 - Historical Market Data Service error message: Historical data request pacing violation

The following conditions can cause a pacing violation:
- Making identical historical data requests within 15 seconds
- Making six or more historical data requests for
  the same Contract, Exchange and Tick Type within two seconds.

4)
Also, observe the following limitation when requesting historical data:
- Do not make more than 60 historical data requests in any ten-minute period.
- If the whatToShow parameter in reqHistoricalData() is set to BID_ASK, then
  this counts as two requests and we will call BID and ASK historical data separately.
